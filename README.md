Supplemental tools for use with [ORSEE](https://github.com/orsee/orsee).

## Select participants in ORSEE whose emails are returned

If a participant's email address becomes undeliverable, you will get lots of failed email returned. You may want to unsubscribe these email addresses. This tool helps make this process easier for large amounts of returned emails and large numbers of participants.

**[Please see these slides on this tool's usage!](https://github.com/lucasreddinger/orsee-tools/blob/master/query-email-csv-slides/query-email-csv-slides.pdf)**
