## Query participants in ORSEE using a file of email addresses

If a participant's email address becomes undeliverable, you will get lots of failed email returned. You may want to unsubscribe these email addresses. This tool helps make this process easier for large amounts of returned email.

The script allows an ORSEE admin to query the participant table from a CSV file of email addresses. The admin can then easily unsubscribe these accounts in bulk in ORSEE.
